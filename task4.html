                    <ul id="pr">
                        <li>Dr. Kalam was born in <strong>Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu on October 15, 1931</strong>, to a humble boat owner.
                            A determined soul since childhood, he started working at an early age to contribute to the
                            family income. He was brought up in a multi-religious, tolerant society; one with a
                            progressive outlook. He overcame all odds and carried on to pursue graduation in physics and
                            later study aerospace engineering on a scholarship.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            He was awarded <strong> Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan and Bharat Ratna – the highest
                        civilian honour</strong>. Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam made every day of his life count for all it’s worth,
                        till very last breath he took.Though he was known by many tags –<strong>‘People’s president’, ‘Missile Man’, ‘The man behind Vision
                        2020’</strong>;
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>His first mark for our country was his accomplishments as a Scientist. Late Dr. Kalam joined
                            Aeronautical Development Establishment of <strong>Defense Research and Development Organization
                            (DRDO) in 1960</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nine years later he was transferred to Indian Space Research Organization. Late Dr. Kalam
                            claimed that joining <strong>ISRO</strong> was one of his biggest achievements in life.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In 2002, both the ruling party, Bhartiya Janta Party, and the Opposition Party, Congress
                            came together to elect him as the <strong>11th President of India</strong>. After serving a term of 5 years,
                            he returned to civilian life of education, writing and public service. He has written a
                            number of books and documentaries, the best known being <strong>Wings of Fire</strong> and Ignited Mind. A
                            recipient of a number of awards, he topped them all by Bharat Ratna, India’s highest
                            civilian honor in 1997.
                        </li>
                    </ul>


                    <ul>
                        <li>He said he found himself when he started to work on the <strong>Satellite Launching Vehicle (SLV)</strong>
                            project. Dr. Kalam made significant contribution as Project Director to develop India’s
                            first indigenous <strong>Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III)</strong> which successfully injected the <strong>Rohini
                            satellite</strong> in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and made India an exclusive member of Space
                            Club. Dr. Kalam took up responsibilities for developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at the
                            DRDO which led to the development of <strong>AGNI and PRITHVI missiles</strong>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>He saw a dream for our country known as Vision 2020. He wanted to see our nation standing
                            amongst the developed countries of the world. The only real tribute to him would be when we
                            manage to achieve that goal as a united country. <strong>“A dream is not that which you see while
                            sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep,”</strong> as he famously said.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>“Dr. Kalam was a man of impeccable character, indomitable spirit, profound knowledge and
                            firm conviction. His death is an irreparable loss to this nation. He has left a big void
                            hard to fill,” said home minister Rajnath Singh.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Former President of India and reputed scientist Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam passed away on Monday
                            evening at a hospital in Meghalaya. Reports say he collapsed while delivering a lecture at
                            Indian Institute of Management in Shillong and was admitted in the hospital in a very
                            critical condition.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                            The Logical Indian Community bids farewell to one of the greatest presidents our country has
                            witnessed. May your soul Rest in Peace, Dr. Kalam. Besides all you have given to our
                            country, you were a Guide, a Teacher and an inspiration to many. You will always remain
                            immortal in our hearts and memories for generations to come.
                        </li>
